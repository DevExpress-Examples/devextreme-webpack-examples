# DevExtreme with a Webpack and Vue example

This [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) example displays DevExtreme widgets loading only required modules. The application contains a button (a [dxButton](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/) widget). When you click this button, an [alert dialog](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/ui/dialog/#alertmessageHtml_title) appears. The example requires [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) to be installed.

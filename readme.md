# DevExtreme with Webpack 

This repository contains a set of examples that show how to use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) with different approaches: [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Each example is an application with a [dxButton](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/) widget. When you click this button, an [alert dialog](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/ui/dialog/#alertmessageHtml_title) appears. All applications require Node.js and npm to install the [DevExtreme](http://js.devexpress.com/) package and its dependencies.

Used Technologies:     | Example Name:
---------------------- | --------------
Webpack with jQuery    | [webpack-jquery](webpack-jquery/)
Webpack with React     | [webpack-react](webpack-react/)
Webpack with Vue       | [webpack-vue](webpack-vue/)

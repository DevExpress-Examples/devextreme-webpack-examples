# DevExtreme with Webpack 

Each example in this section holds a simple application that contains a [dxButton](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/) widget with an [alert dialog](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/ui/dialog/#alertmessageHtml_title).

All examples require Node.js and npm to install [DevExtreme](http://js.devexpress.com/) package and its dependencies.
